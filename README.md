# Instant Insanity Solver
C program to solve the Instant Insanity puzzle

## About
[Instant Insanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_Insanity) is a puzzle involving 4 colored cubes. The goal is to place all cubes in a straight line so that all 4 colors (red, blue, green, and white) are shown on all 4 sides.

## How This Program Works
This program uses a brute-force algorithm to find all possible solutions to the puzzle. Every cube in the puzzle has 3 pairs of 2 colors. When run, this program shows what pairs go together to show all 4 colors, as well as what pairs need to remain hidden. However, this program does not tell the orientation of the cubes. That is for you to discover.

Happy Puzzling...
